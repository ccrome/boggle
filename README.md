# Boggle Solver
Was board, and playing boggle... so I wrote this.

`python boggle.py solve -n 1000` to run 1000 boards and get their soluitons.

`python boggle.py results` to read the results.

On one run, it got a boad with no vowels, and the only solution was `nth`

```
d n w b
g r l h
k t l t
t r n s
```
